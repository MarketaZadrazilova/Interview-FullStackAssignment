# Mock-server

This folder contains a simple mock server that can be used to accomplish the bonus task (fetching the data from a server). It uses [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) under the hood.

## How to run the server
1. Install the dependencies:
`npm install`

2. Start the server:
`npm start`

3. The server should run on your localhost on port 3003.
`http://localhost:3003/services`
